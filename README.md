## __About `zs-` snippets__

`zs-` is the prefix used to identify 0bdx’s collection of ‘front-end snippets’.
A `zs-` snippet can be CSS, HTML, JavaScript, or a combination of all three.

__Each `zs-` snippet is small, and does one thing well. They:__
- Are portable across a wide variety of user agents
- Are backwards-compatible, sometimes supporting ancient user agents
- Have no runtime dependencies
- Can reduce the number of server requests
- Can speed up page loading (FCP, FMP, TTI, etc)
- Can improve security, when used correctly
- Make website and web app code easier to reason about

`zs-` snippets are designed to be placed directly into an HTML page — the web
browser does **_not_** load them as .css or .js files. Therefore, `zs-` snippets
increase the bandwidth of every new HTML page load, since no .css and .js files
are being cached. For that reason, each `zs-` snippet is compressed (generally
around 200 to 500 bytes).

> _The `z` of `zs` is the initial letter of the ‘zero’ of ‘0bdx’._  
> _The `s` of `zs` is the initial letter of ‘snippet’._
